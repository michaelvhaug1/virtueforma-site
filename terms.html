      <h2>1) What Forma Is (and Is Not)</h2>
      <p>Forma is a Catholic habit-tracking and community app focused on prayer, worship, formation, and fellowship. It is designed to encourage users through non-invasive activity sharing, groups, and parish community features.</p>

      <p>User-generated content includes (for example): display name, optional parish fields, and optional activity comments.</p>
      <p><strong>You agree:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not post sensitive personal data in comments or profile fields (examples: confession details, sins, intentions, medical/mental health information, phone numbers, addresses, financial information, or children's information).</li>
        <li>No harassment, threats, shaming, or targeted abuse.</li>

        <li>Display name</li>
        <li>Avatar icons (holy symbols)</li>
        <li>Frame styles (decorative borders)</li>
        <li>Accent colors (liturgically-inspired palette)</li>

    </section>

    <section>

      <p>Forma may send you notifications including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reminder notifications for daily habits and routines</li>
        <li>Social notifications (friend requests, reactions, group activity)</li>
        <li>Weekly digest summaries</li>
        <li>System notifications (account security, policy updates)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can manage notification preferences in the app settings and your device settings. Push notifications require your permission and can be disabled at any time.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8) Visibility, Sharing, and Discovery Features</h2>
      <p>Forma includes friends, a feed, reactions, badges, groups, parishes, and "friend suggestions."</p>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>A) Global Friend Suggestions (In-App Discovery)</h3>
        <p>When you are logged in, Forma may suggest other users to help you connect. Suggested users may show limited information such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Display name</li>
          <li>Experience title (e.g., Seeker, Pilgrim)</li>
          <li>Level</li>
          <li>Points</li>
          <li>Badge count</li>
          <li>Join date</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is in-app discoverability (not a public website directory).</p>
        <p>Not shown in global suggestions: nonprofit preference and parish affiliation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>B) Friends-Only Sharing (Feed and Friend Card)</h3>
        <p>When you are friends with someone, the Service may show:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your display name</li>
          <li>Your activity events in the feed (catalog activity + timestamp + optional short comment)</li>
          <li>Emoji reactions</li>
          <li>Badges and related progress displays</li>
          <li>Nonprofit preference ("Currently supporting {Nonprofit}") on a friend card</li>
          <li>Parish affiliation (if you have provided it)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>C) Groups</h3>
        <p>Groups are covenant-centered communities within Forma:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Groups can be open (anyone can join) or closed (invite-only)</li>
          <li>Group owners define a shared covenant (practice commitment)</li>
          <li>Groups may be associated with one or more parishes</li>
          <li>Group membership is visible to other group members</li>
          <li>You can have up to 5 active groups at a time; completed groups don't count</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>D) Parish Discovery (Privacy-Focused)</h3>
        <p>The Parish Directory allows you to find parishes and groups associated with them. For your privacy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Parish Directory does NOT list individual users who attend a parish</li>
          <li>You CANNOT be added as a friend directly from a parish screen</li>
          <li>You CAN be added as a friend from a group associated with a parish, if you are a member of that group</li>
          <li>Your parish affiliation is visible only to your friends, not publicly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ensures that attending a parish does not automatically expose you to strangers. Connections require mutual group participation or direct sharing of your friend code.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>E) Discoverability and Hide-from-Suggestions Toggle</h3>
        <p>By default, your profile is discoverable in friend suggestions. Forma includes a setting to hide your profile from global friend suggestions. If enabled, you will not appear in suggested users lists, but you may still be connectable by friend code/QR (and other explicit connection mechanisms).</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9) Moderation; Abuse; Enforcement</h2>
      <p>We may remove content, restrict features, suspend, or terminate accounts if we believe it's necessary to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enforce these Terms</li>
        <li>Protect users</li>
        <li>Prevent abuse or fraud</li>
        <li>Comply with law</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10) Service Availability</h2>
      <p>You understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Features may change or be updated</li>
        <li>The Service may be intermittently unavailable for maintenance</li>
        <li>While we take precautions, data loss is possible</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11) Subscriptions and Payments</h2>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>A) Subscription Plans</h3>

        <p>Individual plans include a 30-day free trial for new subscribers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>B) Family Sharing</h3>
        <p>Family plans allow you to share premium features with family members:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The plan owner manages family membership through the app</li>
          <li>Family members receive their own accounts with full premium access</li>
          <li>Family membership does not grant access to other members' personal data</li>
          <li>Removing a family member revokes their premium access</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>C) Billing and Auto-Renewal</h3>
        <p>Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel before the renewal date. You will be charged for the next period unless you cancel.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>D) Payment Processing</h3>
        <p>Payments are processed through the Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android). By subscribing, you agree to their respective terms of service. We do not have access to your full payment card details.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>E) Cancellation</h3>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time through your device's subscription settings (App Store or Google Play). Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You retain access to premium features until then.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>F) Refunds</h3>
        <p>Refund requests must be submitted through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store according to their respective refund policies. We do not process refunds directly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>G) Price Changes</h3>
        <p>We may change subscription prices with notice. Price changes apply to the next billing cycle after notice is given.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12) Charitable Commitment (Nonprofit Donations)</h2>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>A) How It Works</h3>
        <p>Forma commits to donating 10% of subscription revenue to charitable nonprofits selected by users.</p>
        <p>Each user may select a preferred nonprofit from the available options in the app. Your selection determines where your portion of the charitable commitment is directed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>B) Disbursement Threshold</h3>
        <p>Donations to a given nonprofit are disbursed only after the accumulated amount for that nonprofit exceeds $50 by month-end. Amounts below this threshold are held in a temporary account controlled by the Operator until the threshold is reached.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>C) Holding Period</h3>
        <p>If a nonprofit's accumulated donations do not reach the $50 threshold in a given month, the funds remain held and carry over to subsequent months until the threshold is met.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>D) Not a Tax-Deductible Donation</h3>
        <p>Your subscription payment is a payment for services, not a charitable donation. The charitable commitment is made by the Operator, not by you. You should not claim your subscription as a tax-deductible charitable contribution.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>E) Nonprofit Selection</h3>
        <p>The list of available nonprofits is curated by the Operator. We may add or remove nonprofits at our discretion. If your selected nonprofit is removed, you may choose a different one.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>13) Good Faith Submissions</h2>
      <p>Nonprofit and parish information submitted to the Service must be provided in good faith.</p>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>A) Nonprofits</h3>
        <p>Requests to add nonprofits must be for legitimate 501(c)(3) or equivalent charitable organizations. Submitting false, misleading, or fraudulent nonprofit information is a violation of these Terms.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>B) Parishes</h3>
        <p>Parish information (name, location, affiliation) must be accurate. Submitting false parish information or attempting to impersonate parishes you are not authorized to represent is prohibited.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>C) Enforcement</h3>
        <p>Abuse of nonprofit or parish submission features, including fraudulent submissions, spam, or bad-faith requests, may result in:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removal of submitted content</li>
          <li>Restriction of submission privileges</li>
          <li>Suspension or termination of your account</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to verify submissions and reject or remove any content that appears fraudulent or in bad faith.</p>
